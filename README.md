I analyzed an Uber dataset to uncover insights into ride trends, cancellations, and back-to-back trips. Using SQL, I examined frequent start-stop pairs, identified high-demand routes, and detected users taking multiple trips within short intervals.

For cancellations, I calculated the percentage of rides where the start and stop locations matched, helping understand customer drop-off behavior. I also analyzed peak hours, allowing Uber to optimize pricing and driver availability.

Additionally, I worked on detecting back-to-back trips—where users take another ride within 30 minutes—which helps Uber predict demand and improve ride matching.

The insights from this project can help reduce cancellations, improve driver allocation, optimize fares, and enhance user experience, ultimately leading to better efficiency and revenue growth for Uber.
